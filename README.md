**Time-Series Forecasting With TimescaleDB and Prophet**

This project combines the robust storage capabilities of TimescaleDB with the predictive power of Prophet for effective time-series forecasting. By leveraging TimescaleDB, users can efficiently store and manage large time-series datasets, while Prophet allows for accurate forecasting with its intuitive and powerful modeling capabilities.

**Installation**

Setting Up TimescaleDB

Install PostgreSQL and create a database.

Create a Timescale Instance.

Create a table named sales and convert it into Hypertable.

Populate the table with the given data.

**Setting Up Python Environment**

Ensure Python 3.8 or newer is installed on your system.

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries.

****Usage****

**Preparing Your Dataset**

Import your time-series data into TimescaleDB. Ensure your data is in a suitable format for time-series analysis.

Create a hypertable for your dataset using TimescaleDB to enable efficient querying.

**Forecasting with Prophet**

Use the provided Python scripts to extract data from TimescaleDB.

Run the sales prediction scripts to make predictions on your time-series data.

Visualize the data using Plotly to aggregate for different Time zones.
